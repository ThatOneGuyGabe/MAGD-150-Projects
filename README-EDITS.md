<h2>Lab Assignment 1:</h2>
<h3>This was the first assignment I made using p5.js. It is very simple, but I wanted to show my starting point in my journey of learning p5.js. If I were to do it again, I would make it closer to a silhouette, with the nigh sky being a dark blue, the buildings being black, and the windows being yellow. I would also make the moon a little more detailed and add more stars. </h3>

<h2>Lab Assignment 5</h2>
<h3>This was about the halfway point in my assignments. This was one of my favorite ones to think of and create. The idea was to be based on an IBM personal computer. There are two buttons, a circle button to turn it off, and a square one to turn it on. If I were to do this assignment again, I would try to pinpoit the space on the square button to turn it on, and add lines to the IBM logo to make it more resemble the real logo.</h3>

<h2>Tiled-Play</h2>
<h3>This is my most recent project. This was the first I tried making a playble game in p5.js. It was interesting learning the different functions and methods in the library and applying it. This inspired me for my final project where I am going to experiment more with the library.</h3>
